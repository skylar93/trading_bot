## Development Guidelines

### MVP First

- Focus on core functionality
- Test components individually
- Keep changes minimal
- Avoid modifying working components

### Code Modification Rules

```
IMPORTANT: Make minimal changes to:
- train.py
- trading_env.py
- ppo_agent.py

These files are WORKING and STABLE.
Changes should be made through extension, not modification.
```

### Current Focus

1. **Advanced Backtesting System** (Priority)

   - Further scenario development
   - Test additional edge cases (e.g., extreme volatility, correlated assets)
   - Validate new metrics and visualizations

2. **Risk Management**

   - Position sizing
   - Stop-loss mechanisms
   - Portfolio constraints
   - Implement as separate modules

3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**

   - Complete `hyperopt_tuner.py` for Ray Tune integration.
   - Validate with simple experiments and existing training pipeline.
   - Track results with MLflow for reproducibility.
   - Run optimization with `scripts/run_hyperopt.py` for full hyperparameter search.

4. **Real-Time Trading Preparation** (Next Major Goal)

   - **CCXT WebSocket Integration:**
     - Set up real-time data streaming with CCXT.
     - Ensure low-latency data updates.
   - **Trading Environment Adaptation:**
     - Modify `trading_env.py` to support live action application.
     - Implement mechanisms to adjust portfolio positions and balances dynamically.
   - **Live Trading Verification:**
     - Add real-time validation features to the backtesting system for consistency checks.
   - **Paper Trading:**
     - Develop a sandbox environment to simulate live trades without real financial exposure.
   - **Performance Monitoring:**
     - Create real-time performance dashboards using Streamlit or Plotly.

5. **Resource Optimization**

   - Optimize multi-agent training resource usage.
   - Implement GPU utilization strategies (e.g., Ray Actor model).

6. **CI/CD Implementation**

   - Automate testing, backtesting, and deployment using GitHub Actions.
   - Integrate MLflow logging into the pipeline for automated result tracking.

2. **Enhanced Risk Management**
   - Implement additional risk constraints, such as value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional VaR.
   - Introduce automated rebalancing strategies to optimize portfolio allocations under different market conditions.
   - Extend the stop-loss mechanisms to support trailing stops and dynamic thresholds.

3. **Visualization Improvements**
   - Transition to interactive visualizations with Plotly or Dash for enhanced data exploration.
   - Introduce comparative performance analysis to evaluate different agents or scenarios.

4. **Pipeline Scaling and Resource Optimization**
   - Test the current pipeline in a GPU-enabled environment to benchmark improvements.

   - Don't modify working core components
   - Add features through new modules
   - Test thoroughly before integration
   - Keep the stable core stable

2. **Code Changes**

   - Create new files instead of modifying existing ones
   - Use inheritance and composition
   - Keep changes isolated
   - Document everything thoroughly

3. **Current Success Factors**

   - MVP bot runs successfully
   - Advanced scenarios tested and passed
   - Visualization system works
   - Training pipeline stable
   - Risk-aware system operational
   - Proper metrics tracking

Remember: The goal is to extend and enhance, not to modify what works.
